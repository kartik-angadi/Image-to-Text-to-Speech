# Image-to-Text-to-Speech
## Overview
This project utilizes Flask, Tesseract OCR, and pyttsx3 to create a web service that processes images containing text. Upon receiving an image, it extracts the text using Tesseract OCR and then converts the extracted text into speech using pyttsx3. The processed text and the corresponding audio file path are then returned as a response.
